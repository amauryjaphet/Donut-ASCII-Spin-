# Donut-ASCII-Spin
This is a simple code that makes a 3d spinning donut,
I made this with PYTHON 3 And PYGAME

# HOW TO RUN
First, download the latest version of Python
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then go to the cmd, run as administrator and copy this
``` 
pip install pygame
```
If you are getting "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'" error then it means either requests module is not installed or if it is installed then python is not able to find it. If it is not installed then you can easily install by using this command
```
python3 -m pip install requests
```

NOTE: pygame requires a "newer" pip. If pygame starts compiling from source and fails, first try upgrading pip here: 
```
py -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

Then open the python file and THERE YOU GO!!!!
